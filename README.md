Task Management Application

This project is a full-stack task management web application built to demonstrate frontend-backend integration, authentication, and basic CRUD operations.

The application allows users to:

Register and log in securely

Create, view, update, and delete tasks

Maintain authenticated sessions using JWT-based authorization

The primary focus of this project is frontend development and integration, with the backend implemented to support required functionality within limited time constraints.
